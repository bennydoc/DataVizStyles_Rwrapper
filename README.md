# DataVizStyles_Rwrapper
This was an RA project designed to help quickly generate style-guide adjacent graphs directly in R. While not designed for the publication pipeline, the code produces similar graphs which can show researchers roughly what they will eventually look like. Code was written by James Heiabart and reviewed (and submitted to github) by Benny Docter.
