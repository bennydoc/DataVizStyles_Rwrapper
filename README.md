# DataVizStyles_Rwrapper
This was an RA project designed to help quickly generate style-guide adjacent graphs directly in R. While not designed for the publication pipeline, the code produces similar graphs which can show researchers roughly what they will eventually look like. Code was written by James Heiabart and reviewed (and submitted to github) by Benny Docter.

The purpose of this R script is to quickly generate close approximations of what standard data vizualizations will look like the the PS style. This script is not at a place where it can replace or automate the data viz publication workflow by feel free to share screenshots from this R routine as "proofs" of what you'd like PS graphs to look like in pubilcation. The eventual product can then be quickly re-made in excel usng a workbook similar to the "Template Worbook" also found in this repository.
